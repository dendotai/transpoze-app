# 🏆 BRAGGING.md - Clever Solutions We're Proud Of

This document contains non-trivial problems we've solved in creative ways. These are the solutions that make us go "hell yeah, that's smart!"

## Dynamic Edge-Aware Tooltips Without External Dependencies

**Problem**: Tooltips were getting clipped at screen edges, and we needed dynamic positioning like Popper.js but without adding another dependency.

**Solution**: Built a smart tooltip component that:

- Detects viewport boundaries and auto-adjusts position
- Keeps the arrow pointing to the element even when repositioned
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for flicker-free positioning
- Zero external dependencies - just React hooks and CSS

**The Magic**:

```typescript
// Calculate if tooltip would overflow viewport
if (left + tooltipRect.width > window.innerWidth - padding) {
  // Shift left and reposition arrow to still point at element
  left = window.innerWidth - tooltipRect.width - padding;
  const arrowOffset = rect.left + rect.width / 2 - left;
  arrowLeft = `${arrowOffset}px`;
}
```

**Result**: Tooltips that feel native, never get cut off, and work perfectly without 50KB of positioning library.

## Inline Autocomplete for Dynamic Variables (Cursor-style)

**Problem**: Needed autocomplete for `{name}` and `{number}` variables in filename patterns, but dropdown-based solutions felt clunky and interrupted the typing flow.

**Solution**: Built an inline ghost-text autocomplete that:

- Shows suggestions as greyed-out text directly in the input (like VS Code/Cursor)
- Only suggests when it won't require deleting existing text
- Smart detection of when suggestions make sense (e.g., `{nam|}` → suggests `e`, but `{nam|e}` → no suggestion)
- Tab to accept, any navigation dismisses
- Zero flicker - tracks cursor position through multiple events

**The Magic**:

```typescript
// Smart suggestion logic - only suggest if it creates valid output
if (afterCursor.startsWith('}') && suggestionText.endsWith('}')) {
  // {nam|} suggesting "e}" - only insert "e"
  setSuggestion(suggestionText.slice(0, -1));
} else if (afterCursor === '' || afterCursor.startsWith('}') || afterCursor.startsWith(' ') || afterCursor.startsWith('_')) {
  // Safe to suggest - nothing after cursor or valid separator
  setSuggestion(suggestionText);
} else {
  // Check if combined result would still be valid
  const combined = wouldComplete + afterCursor.split(/[}\s_]/, 1)[0];
  const isValidPartial = VARIABLES.some(v => v.startsWith(combined));
  if (!isValidPartial) setSuggestion('');
}
```

**Result**: A subtle, intelligent autocomplete that feels native and never gets in your way - exactly like modern code editors.
